# Market Sales Dashboard

## Overview
This project involves analyzing market sales data to uncover insights related to sales performance, product categories, territories, and additional costs like tax and freight. The data has been cleaned using **Power Query**, and a **Star-Schema Model** was created to organize the information.

It allows for an in-depth analysis of sales performance across different territories, shipping methods, and product categories, helping to identify sales trends and potential areas for improvement.
